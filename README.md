# MERNTube Frontend

Welcome to the Frontend documentation of MERNTube, a Full Stack Video & Audio downloader in the best quality from YouTube powered by YouTube Data API and WebSocket technology. This documentation provides an overview of the frontend architecture, components, and key functionalities of the application.

## Technologies Used

WebSocket: A bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channel. The connection is kept alive until terminated by either the client or the server.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering.

React-Query: A data-fetching library for React applications, enabling seamless data management and caching.

Redux: A state management library, enabling centralized data storage and easy state updates.

React-Router: A routing library for React applications, enabling navigation and URL handling.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework, providing a set of pre-defined classes for styling components.

## React-Query Integration

React-Query is used to fetch and manage data in the frontend. The library provides hooks for fetching data from the backend API, caching responses, and handling loading and error states.

## Redux Integration

Redux is used for global state management in the frontend. It stores user authentication information, such as the JWT token, and manages user-related actions like logging in and logging out.

## React-Router Integration

React-Router is used for client-side routing, allowing smooth navigation between different pages and managing URLs for specific content.

## Powerful YouTube Data API

The YouTube Data API lets you incorporate functions normally executed on the YouTube website into your own website or application. The lists below identify the different types of resources that you can retrieve using the API. The API also supports methods to insert, update, or delete many of these resources.
